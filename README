Getting Started Instructions:

Overview of Steps:
*Create your virtual environment containing the correct requirements
*Configure your settings
*Start the required processes

Create your virtual environment:
Make sure you have pip and virtualenv installed on your system already.

1.  Change into the cloned CeleryManagement directory (where this README is contained)
2.  Run the following:    virtualenv --no-site-packages ve
3.  Activate your virtual environment by running:  source ve/bin/activate
4.  Install the requirements by running:  pip install -r requirements.pip
5.  pip uninstall celery django-celery
6.  pip install -U https://github.com/ask/django-celery/tarball/master#egg=django-celery
7.  pip uninstall celery
8.  pip install -U https://github.com/ask/celery/tarball/master#egg=celery

Notes:
*Need to include celeryconfig.py in this directory.

*celeryconfig.py will be used by djcelerymon.  This should contain AMQP broker information, connecting Settings are similar to ones for celery workers.

*celeryconfig.py should provide database information. This is the database where task information will be stored.  

*Current implementation requires that the djcelerymon and CeleryManagementApp use the same database.
