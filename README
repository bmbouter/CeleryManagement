Need to include celeryconfig.py in this directory.

celeryconfig.py will be used by djcelerymon.  Settings are similar to ones for celery workers.

celeryconfig.py should provide database information. This is the database where task information will be stored.  

Current implementation requires that the djcelerymon and CeleryManagementApp use the same database.
