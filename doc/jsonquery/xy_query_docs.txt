XY Query
########

To retrieve segmentized or x,y data from the database, use the xy_query url for 
the particular model you are interested in.  For instance, for the 
DispatchedTask model, use ``/celerymanagementapp/xy_query/dispatched_tasks/``.  The 
query should be Json and given as POST data.  The response will also be Json.

The Json Query
==============

The Json query has four entries: `filter`_, `exclude`_, `segmentize`_, and 
`aggregate`_.  (The first two are optional.)

.. _filter:
.. _exclude:

Filter and Exclude
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The optional "filter" and "exclude" entries limit the data considered for 
processing.  For instance, if you only were interested in DispatchedTasks that 
were successful, you would filter on ``["state", "SUCCESS"]``.  If you were not 
interested in DispatchedTasks with runtimes below 0.01 seconds, you would 
exclude ``["runtime", "<", 0.01]``.

Other than the name ("filter" or "exclude"), these entries follow the same 
format.  The difference in behavior being that "filter" includes only the data 
that matches its expression(s), and "exclude" excludes any data that matches 
its expression(s).

The value of these entries is a list of filter expressions.  Each filter 
expression is itself a list.  There are three acceptable formats for the filter 
expression::

    [ FIELDNAME , ARG ]
    [ FIELDNAME , OP , ARG ]
    [ FIELDNAME , OP , ARG1 , ARG2 ]
    
Available OPs::
    
    "=="
    "!="
    "<"
    ">"
    "<="
    ">="
    "range"
    
The ``"range"`` OP uses the two-argument form.  All others use the one-argument 
form.  If no OP is given, it defaults to ``"=="``.  In other words, the 
expressions ``[ FIELDNAME , ARG ]`` and ``[ FIELDNAME , "==" , ARG ]`` are 
equivalent.

.. _segmentize:

Segmentize
~~~~~~~~~~

The "segmentize" entry determines the x coordinate in the returned data.  It 
directs how the records are grouped—or segmented—according to some field.  

For instance, one might segmentize on DispatchedTasks' state.  All tasks 
matching a particular state would be grouped together in one segment—and there 
would be one such segment for each state.  In such a case, the x-value would be 
the name of the state.

Another way to segmentize is based on a range broken up into adjacent 
intervals.  Each interval would correspond to a segment.  This is particularly 
suited to representing dates, times, and elapsed times.

One other available segmentize method is to group each record in its own 
segment.  This is for retrieving information on individual items in the 
database—when no summarization is needed.

The value of the "segmentize" entry is a dictionary with two items: "field" and 
"method".

Field
-----

The "field" entry specifies which field to segmentize on.  It must be a field 
that is recognized by the ``jsonquery`` package.  (This is controlled by the 
``jsonquery.modelmap`` module.)

Method
------

The "method" entry specifies how to segmentize the records.  Possible methods 
are: "range", "values", "all", and "each".  The method is given as a list where 
the first value is the name of the method and the second value specifies 
arguments to pass to the method.  Methods that do not take arguments do not 
take a second value.

The "range" method takes three arguments, the minimum value, the maximum value, 
and the interval length.  The arguments are given in a dictionary::

    [ "range", { "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "interval": 0.05 } ]

The "all" method takes no arguments.  It collects all records with the same 
value for the specified field into a single segment.  For instance, if you 
wanted to group DispatchedTasks based on their current state, you might use 
this method.

The "values" method takes a single argument, a list of values.  It is like the 
"all" method, except that only the given values are considered.  This is 
helpful if you are only interested in certain values.  It is also helpful when 
a value does not exist among the records in the database.  This cannot be done 
with the "all" method because it only looks at values that are actually in the 
database.

The "each" method takes no arguments.  It places each record in its own 
segment.

.. _aggregate:

Aggregate
~~~~~~~~~

The "aggregate" entry determines the y coordinate of the returned data.  It 
directs how the segments produced via the `segmentize`_ entry are summarized.  
Some summaries that are possible include "count" and "average".

Like the "segmentize" entry, the "aggregate" entry takes fields and methods.  
However, unlike the "segmentize" entry, the "aggregate" entry can handle 
multiple items.  You can aggregate on multiple fields, with multiple methods 
for a given field, or a combination of both.

The value of the "aggregate" entry is a list of dictionaries; each of which 
controls the aggregation of a specific field::
    
    "aggregate": [
        { AGGREGATE_ITEM },
        { AGGREGATE_ITEM },
        { AGGREGATE_ITEM }
    ]
    
To aggregate on only one field (probably the most common case), only include 
one dictionary in the list.

Each dictionary in the "aggregate" list has two entries: "field" and "methods".  
Note that unlike in "segmentize", here "methods" is plural.

Field
-----

The "field" entry specifies the field to aggregate.  There is a special field 
called "count" which simply counts the number of records in a segment.  In this 
case, the "methods" entry is ignored if present.

Methods
-------

The "methods" entry specifies how the segment is to be aggregated on the given 
field.  The value is a list of method names.  Multiple methods may be given, 
for instance to retrieve the min, max, and avg value::

    "methods": ["average","min","max"]

The possible methods are: "average", "max", "min", "variance", "sum", and 
"enumerate".  Except for the last method, they should be self explanatory.

The "enumerate" method returns the number of occurences of each value within 
the segment.  The result will be a dictionary with the keys being the 
individual values.


The Json Result
===============

The query result is also formatted as Json data.  It is returned as a 
dictionary containing a single entry: "data".  This entry's value is a list of 
x,y data pairs—one for each segment generated by the "segmentize" entry in the 
query.  The x value will always be a single value.   The y value is more 
complicated since it may contain information for multiple fields and/or 
multiple aggregation methods.

Here is a high-level view of the returned data::

    {
        "data": [
            [x0,y0],
            [x1,y1],
            [x2,y2],
            ...
        ]
    }

The y-value will be a dictionary where each entry corresponds to a field in the 
"aggregate" entry in the original query.  If only one field was aggregated, 
there will only be one entry.  The entry's value will be another dictionary 
which contains one entry for each aggregation method used.  

Hopefully the following examples will make this clearer--each shows a **single** 
x,y data pair.

    Data containing the count field::

        [ 
            "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "count", 
                "methods":   [ {"name": "count", "value": 10 } ] 
              } 
            ] 
        ]
        
    Typical single-value x,y data::

        [ 
            "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "runtime", 
                "methods":   [ { "name": "average", "value": 5.0 } ] 
              } 
            ] 
        ]
        
    The enumerate method has more elaborate results::

        [ 
            "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "state", 
                "methods":   [ { "name": "enumerate", "value": [["STARTED",1],["RUNNING",1],["SUCCESS",25]] } ] 
              } 
            ] 
        ]
        
    A multiple field result with count as one of those fields::

        [ 
            "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "runtime", 
                "methods":   [ { "name": "average", "value": 5.0 } ] 
              }, 
              { "fieldname": "count", 
                "methods":   [ { "name": "count",   "value": 188 } ] 
              } 
            ] 
        ]
        
    A multiple field result with two fields::

        [ 
            "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "runtime", 
                "methods":   [ { "name": "average", "value": 5.0 } ] 
              }, 
              { "fieldname": "waittime", 
                "methods":   [ { "name": "max",     "value": 0.08 } ] 
              } 
            ] 
        ]
        
    A multiple method result::

        [ 
            "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "runtime", 
                "methods": [ { "name": "average", "value": 5.0  }, 
                             { "name": "min",     "value": 1.9  }, 
                             { "name": "max",     "value": 18.4 } ] 
              } 
            ] 
        ]
        
    A result showing both multiple fields and multiple methods::
    
        [ "tasks.mytask", 
            [ { "fieldname": "runtime", 
                "methods": [ { "name": "average", "value": 5.0 }, 
                             { "name": "min",     "value": 1.9 }, 
                             { "name": "max",     "value": 18.4 } ] 
              }, 
              { "fieldname": "waittime", 
                "methods": [ { "name": "average", "value": 0.05 }, 
                             { "name": "min",     "value": 0.01 }, 
                             { "name": "max",     "value": 0.08 } ] 
              } 
            ]
        ]
